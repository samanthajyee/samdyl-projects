# 🌀 Sam & Dyl Projects

## 🔗 Project Repos

| Project | Description | Repo Link |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **📊 AI Trading Algorithm** | Reinforcement learning meets market sentiment. A babybot that makes moves like a human. | [samdyl-algo](https://github.com/samanthajyee/samdyl-algo) |
| **⚾ Baseball App** | A scheduling app for athletes. Focused, local, and still under wraps. | [samdyl-baseball](https://github.com/samanthajyee/samdyl-baseball) |
| **🧩 Puzzle App** | Experimental puzzle games that monetize attention. In R&D mode. | [samdyl-brainbarr](https://github.com/samanthajyee/samdyl-brainbarr) |

> 🔒 Descriptions are intentionally vague on this tracker to keep core logic, monetization models, and technical architecture private. As of May 2025, our top priorities are building the BASEBALL MVP and running the ALGO’s Round 2 training loop.

## 🚦 Project Status

### [📊 ALGO](https://github.com/samanthajyee/samdyl-algo) 
**Phase**: Round 2 (Rise Set)  
**Samantha**: RL loop logic, pipeline flow, plotting future reward signals  
**Dylan**: VSCode sync pending    
**Next up**: run `train_loop.py`, save logs, prep for Round 3 (sentiment and actor-critic)

---

### [⚾️ BASEBALL](https://github.com/samanthajyee/samdyl-baseball) 
**Phase**: Initial MVP build  
**Samantha**: repo, project structure, full-stack dev build path  
**Dylan**: frontend UI prototype (Figma), database schema diagram  
**Next up**: booking flow logic, UX for different roles (youth/parent/athlete/coach), payment sketch—if not already covered in diagram

---

### [🧩 BRAINBARR](https://github.com/samanthajyee/samdyl-brainbarr) 
**Phase**: Idea stage (no README or dev yet)  
**Samantha**: —  
**Dylan**: —  
**Next up**: define core gameplay loop, early demo, attention monetization prototype

## 🛠️ Shared Taskboard

- ⏸️ Sync Dylan’s VSCode and repo access: Paused for now  
- 🧪 Run ALGO training loop and review reports (identify signals that could inform reward logic for RL)  
- ✅ Add Figma link of dashboard prototype to ALGO repo  
- ⏳ Add Figma link of app prototype to BASEBALL repo: Coming soon  
- ✅ Choose a BASEBALL build path and tech stack—what can we do, what do we still need to learn?
