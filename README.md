# 🌀 Sam & Dyl Projects

## 🔗 Project Repos

| Project | Description | Repo Link |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **📊 AI Trading Algorithm** | Reinforcement learning meets market sentiment. A babybot that makes moves like a human. | [samdyl-algo](https://github.com/samanthajyee/samdyl-algo) |
| **⚾ Baseball App** | A scheduling app for athletes. Focused, local, and still under wraps. | [samdyl-baseball](https://github.com/samanthajyee/samdyl-baseball) |
| **🧩 Puzzle App** | Experimental puzzle games that monetize attention. In R&D mode. | [samdyl-brainbarr](https://github.com/samanthajyee/samdyl-brainbarr) |

> 🔒 Descriptions are intentionally vague on this tracker to keep core logic, monetization models, and technical architecture private. As of June 2025, our top priorities are building the BASEBALL MVP and running the ALGO’s Round 2 training loop.

## 🚦 Project Status

### [📊 ALGO](https://github.com/samanthajyee/samdyl-algo) 
**Phase**: Round 2 (Rise Set)  
**Samantha**: RL loop logic, pipeline flow, plotting future reward signals  
**Dylan**: VSCode sync pending    
**Next up**: run `train_loop.py`, save logs, prep for Round 3 (sentiment and actor-critic)

---

### [⚾️ BASEBALL](https://github.com/samanthajyee/samdyl-baseball) 
**Phase**: Initial MVP build  
**Samantha**: visioning role-based UX (different for youth/parent/athlete/coach), learning Draftbit  
**Dylan**: big-picture architecture, mapped app flow, whiteboarding UI, learning Draftbit  
**Next up**: finalize flows, screens, and UI/UX by user type, build prototype in Draftbit

---

### [🧩 BRAINBARR](https://github.com/samanthajyee/samdyl-brainbarr) 
**Phase**: Idea stage (no README or dev yet)  
**Samantha**: —  
**Dylan**: —  
**Next up**: define core gameplay loop, attention monetization prototype

## 🛠️ Shared Taskboard

- 📖 Learn Draftbit via their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRXPIDo_qNVejuFZ3OEIJbw) and [website](https://docs.draftbit.com/docs/welcome-to-draftbit) for early BASEBALL frontend dev  
- 🧪 Run ALGO training loop and review reports (identify signals that could inform reward logic for RL)  
- ⏸️ Sync Dylan’s VSCode and repo access: Paused for now  
- 5-19-25 ✅ Choose a BASEBALL build path and tech stack—what can we do, what do we still need to learn?  
- 5-10-25 ✅ Add Figma link of dashboard prototype to ALGO repo
