# 🌀 Sam & Dyl Projects

## 🔗 Project Repos

| Project | Description | Repo Link |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **📊 AI Trading Algorithm** | Reinforcement learning meets market sentiment. A babybot that makes moves like a human. | [samdyl-algo](https://github.com/samanthajyee/samdyl-algo) |
| **⚾ Baseball App** | A scheduling app for youth athletes. Focused, local, and still under wraps. | [samdyl-baseball](https://github.com/samanthajyee/samdyl-baseball) |
| **🧩 Puzzle App** | Experimental puzzle games that monetize attention. In R&D mode. | [samdyl-brainbarr](https://github.com/samanthajyee/samdyl-brainbarr) |

> 🔒 Descriptions are intentionally vague on this tracker to keep core logic, monetization models, and technical architecture private. As of June/July 2025, our top priorities are building the BASEBALL MVP and running the ALGO’s Round 2 training loop.

## 🚦 Project Status

### [📊 ALGO](https://github.com/samanthajyee/samdyl-algo) 
**Phase**: Round 2 (Rise Set)  
**Samantha**: RL loop logic, pipeline flow, plotting future reward signals  
**Dylan**: VSCode sync pending    
**Next up**: run `train_loop.py`, save logs, prep for Round 3 (sentiment and actor-critic)

---

### [⚾️ BASEBALL](https://github.com/samanthajyee/samdyl-baseball) 
**Phase**: Initial MVP build  
**Samantha**: learning Supabase and SQL for backend and database logic  
**Dylan**: big-picture architecture thinking, mapped app flow, whiteboarding UI  
**Next up**: finalize flows, screens, and UI/UX by user type, build prototype in FlutterFlow

---

### [🧩 BRAINBARR](https://github.com/samanthajyee/samdyl-brainbarr) 
**Phase**: Idea stage (no README or dev yet)  
**Samantha**: —  
**Dylan**: —  
**Next up**: define core gameplay loop, attention monetization prototype

## 🛠️ Shared Taskboard

- 📚 Learn FlutterFlow, Dart, and Supabase basics  
- 🧪 Run ALGO training loop and review reports (identify signals that could inform reward logic for RL)  
- ⏸️ Sync Dylan’s VSCode and repo access: Paused for now  
- 5-19-25 ✅ Choose a BASEBALL build path and tech stack—what can we do, what do we still need to learn?  
- 5-10-25 ✅ Add Figma link of dashboard prototype to ALGO repo
